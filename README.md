# Age and Gender Prediction using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the age and gender of individuals using a deep learning model trained on the UTK Face dataset. The workflow involves capturing an image, detecting the face, sharpening the image, and finally predicting age and gender.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `age-gender.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for training the deep learning model.
- `capture.py`: Python script to capture an image, detect the face, and save the sharpened grayscale image.
- `predict.py`: Python script to load the trained model and predict age and gender using the sharpened grayscale image.


```bash
